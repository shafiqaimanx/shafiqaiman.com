`KnownProject` is the CLI tool for findings any subdomain by using the dorking technique or in other word, in passive way for grabbing subdomains.

## Disclaimer
Be careful while using this tool because it can be blocked easily. If you get blocked, just wait a couple of minutes and run it again. On top of that, it only supports the `GOOGLE` engine for now, and it only retrieves the data/subdomains for about `10` pages of Google. Anyways, enjoy! üòâ
