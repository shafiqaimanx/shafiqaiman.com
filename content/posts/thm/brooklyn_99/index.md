## [The First Method]

### Enumeration

First, let’s do an enumeration with the IP address of this machine. I’m gonna run Nmap [Netwok Mapper] to scan any open ports. I’m gonna run this command

```
nmap -sC -sV -oN nmap/initial <machine ip>
```

### Explaining the nmap scan:
* -sC	:= scan using nmap default script
* -sV	:= scan for version
* -oN := output in normal format

![2](2.png)

Nmap scan shows us there is 3 port open. Ports SSH, HTTP, and FTP. I’m interested in the FTP port. You can see, FTP in this machine allows anonymous login. So, let’s try to check it out.

```
ftp <machine ip>
```

![3](3.png)

wow! it is working. We can see the `note_to_jake.txt` file in there. Now, I’m gonna run the get command to download that file into my machine. Let’s see what’s the content of this file.

![4](4.png)

We know that the jake user has a password problem. In this case, we kinda have a potential user at this point. So, I’m gonna try to SSH brute-force with hydra. Remember! the jake user has a password problem. It worth taking a look at.

```
hydra ssh://10.10.129.196 -l jake -P /path/to/wordlist.txt
```

### Foothold/Gaining Access

Let’s try login as jake with that credentials. Yes! We, finally login.

![6](6.png)

First, I’m run the `ls -la` command to list all/hidden in the current directory. To be honest, I’m shocked because I can’t find the user flag. Now, I’m gonna list the `/home` directory to make sure how many users exist on this machine.

Finally, I’m found the user flag.

### Privilege Escalation

First, what I like to do is run the `sudo -l` command to check sudo permission/capability.

![8](8.png)

OK! that’s dope. This user can run the `less command with sudo`. I’m gonna search less exploit to privilege escalation on this site [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/#).

![9](9.png)

Let’s become root now!. *happy face*

![12](12.png)

This is the end of 1st method. Let’s try another method

<hr>

## [The Second Method]

### Enumeration

First, let’s do an enumeration with the IP address of this machine. I’m gonna run Nmap [Netwok Mapper] to scan any open ports. I’m gonna run this command

```
nmap -sC -sV -oN nmap/initial <machine ip>
```

### Explaining the nmap scan:
* -sC	:= scan using nmap default script
* -sV	:= scan for version
* -oN := output in normal format

![2](2.png)

Nmap scan shows us there is 3 port open. Ports SSH, HTTP, and FTP. I’m interested in the FTP port. You can see, FTP in this machine allows anonymous login. So, let’s try to check it out.

```
ftp <machine ip>
```

![3](3.png)

wow! it is working. We can see the `note_to_jake.txt` file in there. Now, I’m gonna run the get command to download that file into my machine. Let’s see what’s the content of this file.

![4](4.png)

Now, we got a lot of potential users here. Anyways, We can see the Nmap result shows us this machine have port 80 running HTTP. Let’s take a look.

![13](13.png)

This is the very first thing I’m gonna do. You always need to check the page source code maybe we can find something interesting. Well, yes we did.

![14](14.png)

That’s weird. We can see the comment says `‘Have you ever heard of steganography?’`. Let’s try to find out what is steganography.

![15](15.png)

So, I’m gonna download this image and try to crack it. First, I’ll try running info using a tool called steghide. Unfortunately, this image is password protected. However, we have a tool to crack it. This tool is called [stegseek](https://github.com/RickdeJager/stegseek). WOW!!! we succeed to crack it.

```
stegseek -sf <img.jpg> -wl /path/to/wordlist.txt
```

![16](16.png)

We can see, it says extracting to `brooklyn99.jpg.out`. Now, let’s read the file content.

![17](17.png)

### Foothold/Gaining Access

That wasn’t expecting at all. We’ve just found the holt user password. Well, let’s try login into SSH with those credentials. FINALLY!!!!! WE’RE IN.

![18](18.png)

### Privilege Escalation

First, what I like to do is run the `sudo -l` command to check sudo permission/capability.

![19](19.png)

Again. Let’s check out any sudo nano exploit in [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/nano/#sudo)

![20](20.png)

First, open the nano text editor. Then, you need to go to the `‘Read File’` command and the `‘Execute command’`. However, in this case, I’m not gonna run the command provide by GTFOBins because it’s crash my shell. Anyways, I’m gonna set `/bin/bash as SUID`.

![21](21.png)<br>
_open the nano text editor_

![22](22.png)<br>
_press the Ctrl+R_

![23](23.png)<br>
_press the Ctrl+X_

![24](24.png)<br>
_set the /bin/bash as SUID_

After done set the `/bin/bash` just press `Enter` and exit out of nano `Ctrl+X`.
Now, run this command `/bin/bash -p` we’re now root.

This is the end of 2 method. I hope you enjoy this room as I did. Well, bye2.

## Conclusion

I’ve learned a lot today. First, do not ever make FTP can log in as anonymous and do not ever put any sensitive data/file in it. Make sure your account is protected by a strong, long, and complicated password. Before I forgot, configure the sudo command properly because that’s an OP command.

This room so much fun and I hope you guys have fun and learn something new today.
