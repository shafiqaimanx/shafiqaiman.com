## Nmap
First, let's scan the IP address by using the Nmap

```

That's a lot of open ports. Port `21/ftp` really caught my eyes. In this scan, it says `Anonymous FTP login allowed`. So, let's check it out.

## FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

Successfully login as an `anonymous` user. OH WOW!. Looks like we've got the entire directory of the server. In this case, the server running `Windows`. On top of that, I've got the `user flag` in the `/Users/Public` directory.

## Http (PRTG Network Monitor)
The Nmap scan above also reveals, that port `80/http` is open and the title was `Welcome | PRTG Network Monitor (NETMON)`. Now, let's check the http site. It's just a login page. 

First, I'm gonna try the default credentials `prtgadmin:prtgadmin`.  Unfortunately, it didn't work but luck is on our side. We already have the access to the server file system through `FTP`.

### Paessler
So, I went googling around the internet and found this [article](https://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/463-how-and-where-does-prtg-store-its-data) about; where does PRTG store its data. The `Data directory` is stored in a folder called `Paessler` that locate in `programdata`. 

To be honest, I am stuck at this point cause I didn't even see the directory called `programdata`. Then, I'm just playing around in the file system and finally found it. Turns out, it's located in the root directory `/programdata`.

![1](cd-into-programdata.png)

### PRTG Configuration.old.bak

Then, I found the `PRTG Configuration` files locate in the directory `/programdata/Paessler/PRTG Network Monitor`. The `.bak` extensions caught my eyes. So, I ended up downloading the 3 config files with the `get` command.

![1](downloading-the-config-file.png)

I manage found the `password` inside the `PRTG Configuration.old.bak` file. So, let's try login in with these found credentials. Unfortunately, it doesn't work. 

![1](read-the-password-from-file.png)

Upon inspection, I found that the file called `PRTG Configuration.old.bak` was created back in `2018`, and the 2 other files were created in `2019`. So, I'm gonna assumed the developers are so lazy and not careful enough with the password. Now, I'm gonna change the password to end with `2018` into `2019`. Let's try it out.

### Http (Welcome PRTG System Administrator!)
![1](system-admin-main-page.png)

YES!!! IT WORKS!!!

This admin page, reveals the version of the software version `18.1.37.13946`. Then, I ask google nicely and found this [article](https://www.codewatch.org/blog/?p=453). The article is about `Command Injection Vulnerability` and got assigned to a [CVE-2018-9276](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-9276).

## RCE (Remote Code Execution)
Then, I'll try to search the exploit in the `searchsploit` databases and find, one that has `(Authenticated) RCE`. We are in luck because I've already got the admin credentials. So, I'm gonna copy the exploit into my current directory with the `-m` flag.

![1](mirror-the-exploit-into-current-directory.png)

The exploit needed the admin `cookies`. Then, Its gonna created the user called `pentest` in the admin groups. In the Nmap scan result above, we see that port [5985](https://www.speedguide.net/port.php?port=5985) is open. The exploit successfully ran. Let's connected to the machine through the credentials `pentest:P3nT3st!`

NICE!
