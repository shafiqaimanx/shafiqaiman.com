## Nmap
Like always, I’m going to scan the IP Address by using [nmap](https://nmap.org/) but I’m going to scan the full port first. Then, I’m going to scan the only open ports.

```sql
nmap -p22,80,443 -sCV -oN nmap/valentine 10.10.10.79

22/tcp  open  ssh      OpenSSH 5.9p1 Debian 5ubuntu1.10 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

The nmap scan result is completed. There are just `3` port opens which are `SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS`. Based on the [OpenSSH](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssh/1:5.9p1-5ubuntu1.10) service banner, this is an Ubuntu (precise) machine. However, on port `443`, the nmap found the `hostname` on the `ssl-cert` scripts scan. The hostname called `valentine.htb` and with that information I'm going to add the name to the `/etc/hosts` file.

![adding the hostname](adding-the-hostname-in-etc-hosts-file.png)

## Https: Valentine.htb
I navigate to port `443` on my browser and accept the `SSL` certificates. I'll check the certificate and nothing useful for me except the `hostname` which nmap already found it. Shockingly, the homepage it's just an image of a woman that looks like screaming at something. The "Something" is an image/logo that is related to the `heartbleed` vulnerability. 

![omg homepage](omg-home-page.png)

Then, I'm running the second nmap scan with the `--script` flag and followed with `ssl-heartbleed` scripts. 

![heartbleed nmap scan](nmap-scan-heartbleed-scripts.png)

The result came back with `"VULNERABLE"` to this type of vulnerability. [Heartbleed](https://heartbleed.com/) is a bug found in the popular OpenSSL cryptographic software library also the CVE assigned to it, called [CVE-2014-0160](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2014-0160), and here's a [great comic](https://xkcd.com/1354/) explaining it.

### Gobuster
Although, I know this web server is vulnerable, based on the nmap scan result above. The homepage itself also gave me a clue and based on the index file extension it's a `PHP` page. Then, I'm going to run the [gobuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster) to search for what's hidden inside this webserver with the `-x` flag for the `PHP` extension.

![gobuster scan result](gobuster-scan-result.png)

### Https: /dev
The `/dev` directory caught my attention because it's on top of course :). Interestingly enough, this directory enables file indexing and shows there are `2` files on it. The first one is called `hype_key` and the second one is called `notes.txt`. 

![file indexing in dev](dev-file-indexing-enable.png)

However, I'm more hype about the `hype_key` file because it sounds interesting but when I clicked it open, it's a bunch of `hex` bytes. So, I'm going ahead to the best [chef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) I know in the entire world and try to ask him about it, and BOOM! Turns out, it's a legit key and I'm going to copy and save it on my machine. Based on the key itself, I assumed this is an `SSH` private key, and it's also `encrypted`. Now, I need to find the passphrase for it.

## Foothold: CVE-2014-0160
Based on this [CVE](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-0160) which is a heartbleed vulnerability. The description says `"which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory such as private key"`. To be honest, I hope I manage to find the passphrase for the private key that I found earlier in the `/dev` directory. Like always, I'll search for the exploit on the `searchsploit` database and manage to find the python exploit.

![searchsploit heartbleed](searchsploit-search-heartbleed.png)

Then, I'm running the exploit and give the victim `IP` as an argument and the output is massive. However, it's a bunch of zero hex bytes of nothing and I'll try to chop some of it by piping the output to the `grep` command. My first time running it, and I can't find anything useful. So, I'll try to keep running it, and finally, I manage to find a `base64` string under the `/decode.php` file. 

```bash
> python2 32764.py 10.10.10.79 | grep -v "00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"

Looks like, someone used the `/decode.php` on this webserver to decode this string before. I navigated to the `/decode.php` page and try to decode it and it managed to encode. The encoded string is human readable and I believe it's a passphrase for the private key.

![decode base64](decode-base64.png)

With this information that I gather, I'll try to `SSH` into the machine using the private key and `hype` as the user. Based on, the name of the key file that I found earlier, first I need to change the permission of the key with this command `chmod 600 <file.key>`. 
However, I've got an error that says `"sign_and_send_pubkey: no mutual signature supported"`, with quick googling I manage to find the [answer](https://transang.me/ssh-handshake-is-rejected-with-no-mutual-signature-algorithm-error/) for it. Then, I'll try again to login in and KACHOW!

![hype user](hype-user.png)

## PrivEsc: Tmux Session
I'm in as the `hype` user and the first thing I love to do is check the sudo permission with the `sudo -l` command. Unfortunately, it does require a password which I don't have. Then, I'll try to list all files in the `/home/hype` directory and I'm amazed that the `.bash_history` file contains something. Most of the time, this file always redirects to the `2>/dev/null` which is nothing.

![bash history file](history.png)

A lot of history contains something to do with `Tmux`. So, I'll try to do a bunch of it and I manage to get root by executing this command `tmux -S /.devs/dev_sess` and it throws me in a `Tmux` session.

ROOT!
